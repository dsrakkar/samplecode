Python has a standard library:
and to call a function you have call the module.
the modules have the functions you need to call:
example:
import random - call the module
random.randint() - call the function in the module

randint is not a built in function like print() this is why you need to call the module where the function is.

you can also call multiple modules like this:
import random, sys, os, math
another way to import all of modules functions:
from random import *
call the function directly:
randint()
